            <div class="info-1">
                <p class="headings">So what exacly is Spiritual Healing?</p>
                The first idea that a normal person may get after hearing these worlds is "healing the spirit".<br>
                Well, they're not wrong, not entirely atleast. Spiritual Healing is the treatment that involves 
                the transfer of energy through the healer to the recipient. It promotes self-healing by relaxing the body, 
                releasing tensions and strengthening the body‚Äôs own immune system.
                Now, it may sound like a pack of gibberish but believe me its not. Its not some hocus-pocus parlour trick
                but a legitimate healing method  that a lot of people have experienced and it has proven effective to them.
                Spiritual healing can be traced as far back as the Bible and has always had its adherents. In recent years, 
                it has gained widespread popularity in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Spiritual
                 healers believe that the therapeutic effect results from the channeling of healing ‚Äúenergy‚Äù from an assumed
                 source via the healer to the patient.
                <p class="headings">How Spiritual Healing works?</p>
                First off, for spiritual healing to take effect you need to believe that it works. You need to have a
                really strong desire to be healed and get better. You cannot just walk upto a spiritual healer and ask
                him for treatment and come out suprised, wondering "How did that even work?".<br>
                You also need to have a calm and peaceful mind. Before seeking a professional, try meditating regularly
                 for about a month. Try to start feeling the energy flowing inside and around you. Drop the constraint of
                 consciousness and become one with the universe. Distance yourself from people who distrupt the positive
                 energy around you. <br>

                 Have a look at this diagram which represents the 7 healing chakra pionts in our body. While meditating, try
                 and focus your energy at these points. This will improve the flow of energy at these points in your body.
                <p class="headings">Its time to heal</p>
                <li>For best experience, sit in a quite room where no one disturbs you. </li>
                <li>You can either sit on a chair or lay down on a bed, just make sure your back is perfectly straight.</li>
                <li>Close your eyes and let the universe work its magic.</li>
